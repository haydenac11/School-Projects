# Incomplete collection of Intro to Graphics projects
Projects were written in C++ and made use of the Vulkan API.

The main project for this class was to create an OBJ viewer that had support for textures, ambient lighting, diffuse lighting, specular lighting, extrinsic rotations, intrinsic rotations, translations, zoom, as well as an arcball camera.
 
Currently working on gathering all files required for the projects to run.

Currently only inlcudes fragment shaders and vertex shaders.

Transformations were largely computed using the glm library.
